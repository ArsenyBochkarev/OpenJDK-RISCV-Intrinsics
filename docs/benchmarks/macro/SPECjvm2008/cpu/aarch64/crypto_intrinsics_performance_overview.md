Overview of crypto intrinsics performance on SPECjvm2008 `crypto.aes` benchmark.

It seems to me that AES-related crypto intrinsics have no somewhat significant importance on SPECjvm2008 `crypto.aes` macrobenchmark performance. Despite being used, their influence is very small: on Rock5b board the ops/m metric showed the lowest score of 73.06 when all intrinics were **enabled**, which is **lower** than with **disabled** `_cipherBlockChaining_decryptAESCrypt` and `_cipherBlockChaining_encryptAESCrypt` intrinsics.
